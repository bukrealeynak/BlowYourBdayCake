## 🧁 About the Project

This is a mini web project I created for someone special to me on their birthday.  
It’s a digital cake with **five auto-placed candles** that can be “blown out” using real microphone input.  
The project simulates a birthday moment — even if we're far away — using only a browser and sound.

Because no birthday should pass without cake — even if it's digital. 💖


## 🕯️ How It Works

- When the page loads, **five candles** are automatically added on the cake.
- A message appears on top with your personalized birthday wish.
- If your browser allows microphone access, it will **listen for sound frequency**.
- If you **blow into the mic** (or make a similar strong sound), the candles will **flicker and extinguish** randomly.
- No clicks, no touch — just blow!


## 💻 Technologies Used

- **HTML5** — for structure
- **CSS3** — for the beautiful cake layers, candles, and flame animation
- **JavaScript** — for:
  - Creating and placing candles
  - Handling flame animation
  - Using the Web Audio API to detect blowing via microphone input


## 📦 Features

- Candle flame flickering effect
- Real-time microphone frequency analysis
- Clean, responsive layout
- Personalized birthday message
- Fully client-side — no data stored or sent


## 🔒 Privacy

This project only runs **locally in your browser**.  
It does not record, store, or transmit any sound. Your microphone access is used only to detect blowing in real-time, and nothing is saved.


## ♻️ Reuse & Personalization

You're more than welcome to **fork or clone** this project and modify it:

- Change the birthday message
- Adjust the number of candles
- Customize styles, colors, or animations
- Create your own version for friends, family, or loved ones


## 💓 Final Note

I hope it makes someone smile, just like it did when I built it for a person who means the world to me. 🌍💫
